=head1 NAME

HTML::HeadParser::Liberal - More Liberal HTML Head Section Parsing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use HTML::HeadParser::Liberal;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

HTML::HeadParser::Liberal is an evasive module that patches HTML::HeadParser
directly (and globally) so that workarounds for certain quirks are enabled.

Currently this module supposrts the following:

=over 4

=item Meta names passed to HTTP::Headers are munged

Currently all ":"'s are converted to a hyphen, so things like 

    <meta name="twitter:card" ...>

doesn't choke, and you can access this value from HTTP::Headers like

    $h->header('X-Meta-Twitter-Card');

Note that YOU DO NOT NEED THIS HACK if you're using a recent enough LWP.
Because of this I was initially going to let this module die a slow death,
but then I have since been told that there are environments stuck with old
modules, so I guess there are some situations where this module is still
useful.
